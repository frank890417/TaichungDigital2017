### Introduction

Trivial Sampling is an artwork contributed to the Digital Curation Project for Taichung Digital Culture Center Initiative. 
The event itself is a highly experimental online exhibition to test the possibility of curation and the role of curator. 
At the same time, participated artists also challenge themselves by the uncertainty of the material they could use.

In this work, the artist collect images and metadata from the social network by searching specific locations, colors, or features.
In terms of searching on the Internet, it's a subjective and trivial data collection. 
However, when searching by a specific set of metadata (or keywords) iteratively, and subjectively croping, refocusing, and transforming the material,
the patterns of the trivial everyday things will emerge.

「日常取樣」是台中數位文化中心專案辦公室的數位策展計畫參展作品之一。此展覽為線上展覽，其策展計畫本身具有很高的實驗性，
試圖摸索數位策展的可能性、以及策展人的角色。同時，參與展覽的藝術家也面對不少挑戰，包括創作素材的不確定性。

本作品試圖透過搜尋與取樣方法由社群網路擷取影像素材，根據色彩、材質、地理位置進行取樣，以取樣地圖形式呈現。
由此，看似個人、隨意的日常取材，藉由取樣過程中主觀、聚焦、切割與轉換，以及地理、顏色等關聯性串連，可能呈現怎樣的臺中日常呢？

### Technically Speaking

Trivial Sampling take advantage of the Cultural Query Toolkit to simplify the query and processing of social network data 
so that the artist could spend more time on creation rather than resolving the hassle of connections.

### Commands

Use the following keyboard commands to alter the contents:

* `D`: District mode (default). In this mode, images are updated according to district.
* `C`: City mode. In this mode, all images will be updated together.
* `Space`: Force update right away.
* `I`: Turn on/off command hints.
* `Left Arrow` and `Right Arrow`: Switch between different topics.
